#   Sunrise:  A schematic agent to brighten your day

Use Sunrise to start a new “empty” Urbit app project.  Import the repo, then simply rename all text and files from `sunrise` to whatever your new agent's name will be.  Run `./rename.sh new-name` to replace all instances of `sunrise` with `new-name` throughout.

You should place Sunrise in a directory next to `urbit` (the main Urbit repo) and `landscape` from Tlon.  Copy from it using `cp -rL` to resolve symlinks.

Sunrise is modestly opinionated but generally straightforward.  If you are interested in having the `++abet` nested-core pattern in your agent, see [Moonrise](https://github.com/sigilante/moonrise).
